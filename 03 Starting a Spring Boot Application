Springboot is a standalone application.
It does not neeed server to be deployed on. It works by having a class with main method that you can start.

WHAT HAPPENED WHEN WE STARTED THE SRPING BOOT CLASS:
1. sets up default configuration.
2. Starts Spring Application context
3. Performs class path scan: If we wanted to create a business service then we can add Service Annotation after creating class. Every class has a marker.
4. Starts Tomcat server
