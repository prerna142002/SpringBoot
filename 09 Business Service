Business Service in Spring are basically singleton.
Spring creates the instance of this service and then it keeps in the memory (registers the instance)

When we have an input in the resource path then we need to tell the spring by using the @PathVariable annotation.
 
If we have a variable input in another name and we need to send this then :
@GetMapping("/topics/{foo}") // This will not work as it will map only java
	public Topic getTopic(@PathVariable("foo") String id) {
		return topicService.getTopic(id);
	}
